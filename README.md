# Resume Analyzer

A full-stack React app (built with the React Router full-stack template) for uploading and reviewing resumes in a clean UI.

> Status: in progress / learning project

---

## ✨ What this project does

- Upload and manage resumes (UI + app flow)
- Display resume details / feedback in a structured way
- Built as a modern React Router full-stack app with TypeScript and Tailwind-ready styling

*(If your app already does ATS scoring / AI feedback / job matching, tell me and I’ll customize this section to match exactly.)*

If you want, paste your `package.json` (just the dependencies + scripts part) and I’ll tailor the README to your *exact* stack + commands (and add accurate “Features” based on what your app actually does).
